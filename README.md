#Getting_and_Cleaning_Data - Course Project

This repository hosts the R code (run_Analysis.R) and documentation files for the Data Science's course "Getting and Cleaning data".

1. run_Analysis.R - The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

	*The file contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.


	*The output of the 5th step is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.

2. CodeBook.md - Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
